# Hello World
First Venture!
It's telling me to write a bit about myself, so I like the Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones, oh and Humans.

## Update on 8th January 2020
So I've learnt a bit more about Git now and how it works, and got much more into development, that 'bio' above seems like a lifetime ago and it strikes me that no-one outside the UK will probably know what Humans even is! British TV show, it stars Gemma Chan who has since gone on to actually do some pretty big roles, Minerva in Captain Marvel comes to mind, and the mysterious woman at the end of one of the Transformers movies.

I'm now going to use this repo to print "Hello world" in whatever language(s) I happen to be practising at the time.
